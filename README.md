# Brainfuck
non-optimizing brainfuck interpreter

## features
this interpreter is not intended to be massively optimized  
but it has two basic optimizations that i think is the  
bare minimum for non-debugging brainfuck interpreters  

- aggregates modifying operations into one.
- instant jump operations.

not a serious project, usable but slow.
